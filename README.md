# About
This was Team 14's submission to the annual CFM 101 Team Competition at the University of Waterloo, where it achieved 2nd place.
# How it works
When given an arbitrary list of stocks, our program performs statistical analyses and picks certain stocks out of the list to form the safest portfolio possible.
# Usage
If you're interested in trying out our program, simply go through the following steps:
1. Download the `.ipynb` file from our repository
2. Open the file in your notebook editor of choice
3. Install the packages in `requirements.txt` (you can do this by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal with `requirements.txt` in your root directory)
4. Assemble a list of stock tickers as a `.csv` file, just like `Tickers_Example.csv` in our repository.
5. Run the `.ipynb` file, and you should see a file `Stocks_Group_14.csv` in the same directory as the notebook which has the selected stocks.
